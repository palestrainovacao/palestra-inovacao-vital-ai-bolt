  # Fix Organization RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing RLS policies on the organizations table
    - Create a completely permissive INSERT policy for authenticated users
    - Re-add SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE policies with appropriate conditions
    - Ensure users can create organizations during signup

  2. Purpose
    - Fix the "new row violates row-level security policy for table organizations" error
    - Allow authenticated users to create organizations without restrictions
    - Maintain proper access control for other operations
